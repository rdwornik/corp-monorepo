"""Deterministic document type classifier.

Classifies files into doc_types based on folder path and filename patterns.
Does NOT use LLM — pure rules. Fast and free.

doc_type determines extraction depth:
- "architecture", "security", "commercial", "product_doc" -> deep extraction
- "rfp_response" -> deep extraction
- "meeting", "training" -> deep extraction (meeting overlay)
- "general" -> standard extraction (base only)
